<strong>WARNING:</strong> Crunchy PostgreSQL for Pivotal Platform cannot be directly upgraded from v4 with PostgreSQL v9.5 to v5 with PostgreSQL v10.
</br>
Instead, perform a migration upgrade, rather than an in-place upgrade. For more information regarding migrations, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/partners/crunchy/migration.html">Migration</a>.

If continued support is needed for PostgreSQL v9.5, contact
<a href="mailto:crunchypcf@crunchydata.com">Crunchy Data for Pivotal Platform</a>.
For additional consulting assistance to plan a data migration effort, contact us at <a href="mailto:info@crunchydata.com">info@crunchydata.com</a>
