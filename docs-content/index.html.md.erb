title: Crunchy PostgreSQL For Pivotal Platform
owner: Crunchy Data
---

Using the cloud-native platform Pivotal Platform, Crunchy Data
engineers have created a service offering that provides a secure, reliable,
and robust database infrastructure delivered as "Database-as-a-Service"
(DBaaS). Crunchy Certified PostgreSQL for Pivotal Platform provides a Marketplace service
and complete PostgreSQL infrastructure to enable any applications deployed to
Pivotal Platform to utilize PostgreSQL databases in a self-service, on-demand manner. This
allows developers to focus on coding and not the underlying infrastructure.

This documentation describes the Crunchy PostgreSQL for Pivotal Platform
(Pivotal Platform) tile. Installing this tile creates a service that allows Pivotal Platform developers
to use Crunchy PostgreSQL databases with their apps.
In order to provide our customers with the best possible environment, Crunchy
Data engineers have created an infrastructure that provides the following key
features:
