#### Using Cloud Foundry CLI

When the status of your service is **create succeeded** you can bind an app to
the service by running `cf bind-service APP_NAME SERVICE_INSTANCE`,
substituting `APP_NAME` with the name of your Pivotal Platform app and `SERVICE_INSTANCE`
with the name of your service. For example:

```
cf bind-service myApp <%= service_instance_name %>
cf restage myApp
```

Binding parameters can be passed in as the binding is created. For example:

```
cf bind-service myApp <%= service_instance_name %> -c '{"parameter": value}'
cf restage myApp
```

The acceptable parameters are as follows:

##### Optional Binding Parameters

| Parameter        | Description                                                                            | Example Value | Parameter Limitations               | Notes                                                                |
| :--------        | :----------                                                                            | :--------     | :-----------:                       | :--------------------                                                |
| `use_md5_auth`   | Enables MD5 auth methods                                                               | `true`        | Value must be boolean true or false | Can be used if the app does not support SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication |
| `stats_access`   | Allow users to create service bindings with superuser visibility of `pg_stat_activity` | `true`        | Value must be boolean true or false | Access must also be enabled in the service instance                  |
| `remote_replica` | Properly configure connection for a standalone remote replica instance                 | `true`        | Value must be boolean true or false | Only valid on standalone-replica instances                           |

If access to stats is enabled in your service instance, you can optionally enable this feature at binding time. With stats enabled you will be able to access the `pg_stat_activity` and `pg_stat_statements` views that are created in your service database. You can access these tables by calling `SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity` in the Crunchy PostgreSQL 10 tile and `SELECT * FROM monitor.pg_stat_activity()` in the Crunchy PostgreSQL 9.5 tile.

<p class="note">
<strong>Note:</strong> You must restage or restart your app before it will have access to the service
credentials.
</p>

<p class="note">
<strong>Note: </strong>
MD5 Authentication is considered cryptographically broken.
Any and all efforts should be made to utilize SCRAM-SHA-256 authentication where possible.
